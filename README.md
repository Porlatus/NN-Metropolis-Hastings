Practical significance of the work
Alignment of results with the set goals and objectives

The main goal of this work was to investigate the effectiveness of the Metropolis-Hastings sampling algorithm in the task of image classification with neural network models and compare it with the popular alternative, gradient descent. The following tasks were accomplished:
• Two different neural network architectures were developed: a convolutional network and a fully connected network.
• An investigation was carried out on the influence of the training and testing sample ratio on the performance of the fully connected neural network model, trained on the MNIST dataset using the Metropolis-Hastings numerical sampling algorithm as the network optimizer.
• Metropolis-Hastings sampling was performed for both the fully connected and convolutional models.
• A comparison was made between the performance of the sampling algorithm and gradient descent.
